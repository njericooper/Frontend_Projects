# An About Face my dev path to learn Java from HackerRank

## Learning Journey

### Day 1

Learned stdout and in

### Day 2

Realized I was grasping at straws trying to set up my dev environment, so I bought a PluralSight membership. Currently following the Java path.

Beginner section is 50+ hours. If I obsess and do 5-10 hours a day at 1.5 speed, I can wrap it up in 4-6 days.

#### Day 2 Learning

Learned class file, Java GUIs - AWT, Swing, JavaFX

I'm pretty sure that I may be just using VS Code, terminal, and Git.

I could be wrong. We'll see.

Java Virtual Machine, Java SE APIs, Spring Boot, Spring, and other microframeworks

Mobile Java Dev with Android

Java =! Java Android

### Day 3

Learning Practices and common tools. Idk if these tools are still common. The IDEs they taught look booty.

SonarQube for CI/QC? No git actions? Or.. am I tripping. Starting to wonder if I'm going to thrive at Java. Did Javascript and highter level languages spoil me?

Groovy is n alternative JVM language. Never heard of it.

Beginning to set up Java Development Environment. I'm going to need more coffee for this.

### Day 4

The course saya use IntelliJ, but I'm trying to find how the cool kids do it with VS Code.

So, I've installed all the Extentions and used Homebrew. Cask is depreciated and I am not able to get the most updated version of the SDK. Hopefully there's a docker container for Java Development. I'll pick up from this thought first thing in the morning. In the evenings, I Learn algorithms with CodeAcademy app for about an hour until I KO. Yes, it's eat, sleep, code season

### Day 5

Found a Livestream from VS Code on How to Set up a Java environment. I think my time would be better spent if I learn algorithms and reading/coding along with Cracking the Coding Interview book.

### Day 6

Still am not able to get Java runtime to work on my machine. Going to about face back to JS and Python. I'll do the algo problems along with the book. Dang just remember Replit exists. No compiler needed. Follow along here. https://replit.com/@njericooper1/Learning-Java#Main.java

### Day7

Working on algos on a mobile app on my phone. Will do code challenges here
